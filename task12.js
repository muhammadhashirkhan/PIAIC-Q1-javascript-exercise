// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let names = ["Rafay","Ghayour","Kashif","Miran","Hasnain"];
console.log("Hello " + names[0] + "! Let's do some JavaScript.")
console.log("Hi " + names[1] + "! Are you intrested to have a lunch with me?")
console.log("Hey " + names[2] + "! Let's have a cup of tea together.")
